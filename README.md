# Minesweeper for Microsoft Excel

To run the code just open the **minesweeper.xlsm** file in Excel. You'll to enable content and macros to be able to run it.

If the game appears to be buggy when started delete the current tab and start the game again. Sometimes it gets messed up, I don't know why, it's Visual Basic for Applications magic or something.

Have fun!
